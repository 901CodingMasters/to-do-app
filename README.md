# To-Do-App

A HTML, JavaScript, CSS app that allows the user to input to do items and be able to remove them!

This is a project created in the CodeCrew program, its a to-do list app that uses javascript to add ideas to the project, and let you cross them out. When the page is refreshed it will retain the ideas with local storage.
